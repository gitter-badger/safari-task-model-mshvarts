## Safari modeling challenge 2015 -- Mike's model

Feel free to use this however you want. A few requests: 

1. Don't push to master. Either fork it, or work in a branch. This will save everyone headaches. 
2. If you use it, it would be awesome if you contribute back anything useful you come up with. 

## How to run me

For now: 
```
Rscript preprocess_tours.R
Rscript idealObs_wienerModel_maxLik.R
```
